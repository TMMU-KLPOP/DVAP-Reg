# DVAP-Reg: Dual-View Anatomical Prior-Driven Cross-Dimensional Registration for Spinal Surgery Navigation

## Introduction
This study describes a dual-View anatomical prior-driven cross-dimensional registration for spinal surgery navigation.


## Open Source
The paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging. Once the article is published, we will open the source code of the project.
Additionally, the 2D/3D-SimReg and -HybReg datasets, as well as the 2D/3D-CDIR platform constructed in the paper, will be submitted to the National Fundamental Science Public Data Center (https://www.nbsdc.cn/).
